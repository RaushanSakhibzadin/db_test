# Test Automation Plan for Fivetran Local Data Processing

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Objective**: Ensure comprehensive coverage of Fivetran Local Data Processing's functionality, performance, and reliability through automated testing.
- **Scope**: Automated testing of the installation process, data processing capabilities, interactions with source and target locations, and system components (Local Processing Hub System, High-Volume Agent, Web UI, CLI, REST API).

## 2. Automated Test Environment Setup
- Configure automated test environments across Linux, Windows, Unix, and various database/file storage systems.
- Automate deployment and configuration of these environments.

## 3. Tool Selection
- Choose automation tools for diverse environments that support database, API, and UI testing.
- Ensure tools are compatible with continuous integration systems.

## 4. Test Data Management
- Develop scripts for automatic generation and management of test data, covering a broad range of scenarios.

## 5. Automated Test Cases and Scripts
- Automate testing for:
  - Installation on supported operating systems.
  - Data capture, compression, encryption, and transmission functions.
  - Each component within the Local Processing Hub System.
  - Operation of the High-Volume Agent.
  - Interaction with Web UI, CLI, and REST API.

## 6. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines
- Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines for execution on code commits or scheduled builds.

## 7. Reporting and Analysis
- Use automated reporting tools for capturing and analyzing test results.
- Automate error report generation for failed tests.

## 8. Maintenance and Updates
- Regularly update and maintain test scripts to align with new features and application changes.
- Automate updates for test environments and tools.

## 9. Documentation
- Document the automated testing process, including details of test cases, scripts, and environment setup.
